# Semantics M7CI

This [test](.) is exercising the semantics rule [M7CI](../Readme.md).

### Description

In this test, feature `make` calls feature `f` in lower-case. But the corresponding feature is declared with a name `F` in upper-case. This is valid because the Eiffel language is case insensitive.
